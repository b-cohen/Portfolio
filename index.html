            Hello, I am Brittany Cohen and the current technical director at
            Base Camp Coding Academy (BCCA). Base Camp Coding Academy is a non
            profit organization that provide students the opportunity to become
            full stack web developers. Base camp is located in Water Valley, MS
            and tuition is 100% free for all of our students.Base Camp Coding
            Academy is a hands-on, challenging, and fun program designed to
            train recent high school graduates to be software engineers. In an
            intimate classroom setting, students work with real world
            technologies to learn the fundamentals of coding, app development
            and the life leadership skills they will need to be successful in

            Before becoming the technical director, I was the Engineering and
            Exploring Computer Science instructor for the North Panola School
            District. I have five years of experience at North Panola Career and
            Technical Center. During my tenure in public education, I was able
            to partner with researchers from the University of California Los
            Angeles(UCLA). Our research was focused on equity in computer
            science especially in the Mississippi Delta. I had the pleasure to
            collaborate with Dr. Jean Ryoo UCLA researcher and Jane Margolis
            author of Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing
            for several years in the classroom.
          </p>

            In 2018, I was able to be assist in writing the exploring computer
            science curriculum for the state of Mississippi. I also help write
            several Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) grants for
            North Panola. In 2020, I was named Teacher of the Year by the Panola
            County Partnership.
